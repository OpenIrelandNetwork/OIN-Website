#### ðŸ”§ [Open Source and InnerSource Skills in Ireland: A Call for Action](https://www.skillnetireland.ie/uploads/attachments/Open-Source-and-InnerSource-Skills-in-Ireland-A-Call-for-Action.pdf)
**Description:**  
Open source and InnerSource provide opportunities for seamless collaboration and innovation within and between organisations in the tech sector.  
This report outlines the key advantages of leveraging open source and InnerSource in Ireland, and highlights how investing in these skills can fulfil talent needs and position Ireland as a leader in this space.

### ðŸ“š Open Ireland Network Learning Resources

One of the recommendations from our report on Open Source and InnerSource skills in Ireland was to create a directory of Learning Resources. The **Open Ireland Network Learning Resources Project** is a response to that recommendation.

This is an **open source project** maintained by the Open Ireland Network that aims to compile a comprehensive collection of learning materials centered around **Open Source** and **InnerSource**, specifically tailored for **Irish IT professionals and developers**.

We envision this collection as a **dynamic resource**, welcoming and encouraging **everyone** to add and share links and information. Our ultimate goal is to **foster continuous learning and skill enhancement** within the Irish community.

**Description:**  
The MOSS-I framework is designed to guide the research and academic community in understanding and applying Open Source Software (OSS). It includes:

- Awareness-building around OSS use and practices  
- Licensing models and considerations  
- Guidance from Irelandâ€™s Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs)  
- Tools for contributing to and creating OSS within universities  

This framework draws from international best practices and tailors them to the Irish research ecosystem.
